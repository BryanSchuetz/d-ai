{"prompt": "Haiti Resilient Environment—North (HRE-N)\nCustomer: USAID\nContract Date: October 2022\nPeriod of Performance: Five years\nEstimated Revenue: $23 million\n\nWe are delighted to announce that DAI has been awarded the Project Payasages Resilients—Nord/Haiti Resilient Environment—North (HRE-N) Activity. HRE-N is a five-year initiative to strengthen communities, local systems, and climate resilience in Haiti’s Northern Resilience Focus Zone; it will protect and restore ecosystem services using a watershed management approach that fosters sustainable productivity—through interventions such as enhanced agroforestry and soil conservation techniques—and economic inclusion. \n\nThe activity will strengthen a range of integrated resilience capacities to build and protect productive assets and investments in the environment, sustainable livelihoods, social cohesion, and local systems. Combining shock-response approaches, risk mitigation, coordination with local early warning and response mechanisms, and long-term adaptation strategies, the activity will take a holistic approach to Haiti’s many challenges, which include climate change and extreme weather events, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential emergence of other diseases, the resurgence of conflict and violence, and generally weak governance and systems.", "completion": "In northern Haiti, the Bahon, Joli Trou, and Les Perches sub-watersheds provide critical ecosystem services for local communities. Water availability, erosion control, and forested watersheds are particularly important for the sustainability of crop and livestock production on which these communities rely for income, food security, and resilience to shocks and stressors. While many households in these sub-watersheds are aware of improved natural resource management (NRM) practices and technologies, a majority live in poverty and lack the time, resources, and finances to utilize these practices in a consistent or scalable manner. With drought and increasingly intense natural disasters brought on by climate change, prioritizing the ecological health of the sub-watersheds is even more imperative.\n\nTo help address these issues, the U.S. Agency for International Development designed the Haiti Resilient Environment North (HRE-N) Activity, to build communities’ resilience to reduce chronic vulnerability and facilitate inclusive growth. Despite a challenging context, HRE-N, or Projet Paysages Resilients in French, represents an opportunity to support shifts in watershed management practices across households, communities, and sub-watersheds.\n\nBy systematically fostering local ownership and identifying incentives through regular engagement with stakeholders, our watershed management approach will align economic incentives with improved NRM practices. By combining this with improved organizational and technical capacity of communities and stakeholder groups, our approach ensures that HRE-N will leave behind more self-reliant local actors and interventions that lead to long-lasting change.\n\n###\n\n"}

DAI will act as a subcontractor to the local Ethiopian firm, First Consult PLC.\n\nThe project is in large part an outgrowth of the DFID-funded Enterprise Partners/Private Enterprise Programme Ethiopia (PEPE), where First Consult and DAI have partnered for several years to support the parks as sources of jobs and as hubs for broader economic development. By supporting job creation initiatives in and around the parks—and fostering market linkages between the parks and Ethiopia’s micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs)—Bridges aims to help create close to 600,000 youth jobs (80 percent of them women) and 15,000 MSMEs, while training 300,000 unemployed young people. \n\nThe project will focus on three areas:\n\nLabor: Bridges will scale-up PEPE’s proven worker recruitment and retention interventions to six further industrial parks, increasing the total number of parks we are working with from four under PEPE to 10.
